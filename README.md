Kicking off my coding journey with a splash, I made progress on my 100 Days of Code challenge by adding the projects from the first three days:
Day 1: Band Name Generator – A fun little tool to come up with creative band names.
Day 2: Tip Calculator – A simple calculator to help users figure out tips for their bills.
