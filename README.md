Kicking off my coding journey with a splash, I made progress on my 100 Days of Code challenge by adding the projects from the first three days:
Day 1: Band Name Generator – A fun little tool to come up with creative band names.🎸
Day 2: Tip Calculator – A simple calculator to help users figure out tips for their bills.💸
Day 3: Treasure Island – An interactive adventure story where choices lead to different outcomes.🏝️
